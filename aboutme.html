        <p>Hey there! I'm Alagappan Sellappan, and I am a  rising high school senior based out of the Greater Richmond Area in Central Virginia. In addition to being a student,
            I am also the director of technology focusing on the technical aspects of a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, database manager at a startup company built for students by students,
        president of my school's coding club, webmaster at other school-based organizations, and a whole assortment of other projects. </p>
        <p> My passion is to help people with the skillsets under my toolbelt. Tying this with my interest of analyzing data and the biological sciences, I aspire to become a computational biologist/
            bioinformatician with a path to get a Ph.D in Computer Science and then heading into the technology workforce. </p>
        <p>When I'm not clacking my keyboard, I am usually hanging out with family and friends (virtually of course) or watching my favorite crime-based shows on Netflix or CBS.</p>
